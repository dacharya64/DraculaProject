# README

This website is a work in progress. It will host an interactive gallery with pictures from the Dracula project I'm working on. 

## What is this Dracula project? 
I'm working on a project taking the original text of Bram Stoker's Dracula and breaking it apart into the physical media that make up the story (letters, postcards, journals). I'm creating handmade replicas of these individual pieces, trying to do my best to replicate what these different assembled pieces of media would have originally looked and sounded like. 

It's partly a different way of visualizing the original novel in a new, physicalized way, and partly an experiment to see how the epistolary format of the original work can be understood when actually broken apart into its component parts.
